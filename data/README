Here's how we store the people.

- First, I manually download some docs from google docs containing lists of names_raw.txt.
- Then I use cleanup.sh to distill the names into a single text file names.txt.
- get_images.py is used to download URLs and store them in 'faces', which is symlinked into www
- We need to generate interests for each name, generate_interests.py, which makes names_interests.txt
- The script in the previous directory, clone_init.py can build the people and people_interests database
from names_interests.txt.
